# Smart Home E-shop

This project is about the development of an e-commerce website of a shop selling smart home products. The system includes two main subsystems: the adminstration system and the consumer system.

In the administrative subsystem, the administrator is able to manage the users of the system (CRUD Operations), manage the products of the shop (CRUD operation) and manage the orders that have been made.

In the consumer system, consumers can browse and search products, add them to favorites or to the cart and eventually creating orders. Also they can see their user profile and check, return or cancel their orders.

## System Implementation

The project is made in XAMPP using the Apache server and PHP as the main coding language and the database is implemented with mongodb. The architecture of the system relies on the MVC framework (model-view-controller)
